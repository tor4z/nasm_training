# NASM SEL


## Quick Notes


### Moving immediate values

Consider the instruction:

	mov [L], 1

The assembler will give us an error: “operation size
not specified”!
Labels have no type (they’re NOT variables)

	mov dword [L], 1	; 4-byte double-word



### Brackets or no Brackets
```
	mov eax, [L]
```
* Puts the content at address L into eax
* Puts 32 bits of content, because eax is a 32-bit register
```
	mov eax, L
```
* Puts the address L into eax
* Puts the 32-bit address L into eax
```
	mov ebx, [eax]
```
* Puts the content at address eax (= L) into ebx
```
	inc eax
```
* Increase eax by one
```
	mov ebx, [eax]
```
* Puts the content at address eax (= L + 1) into ebx

### CLC, CLD, CLI, CLTS: Clear Flags

```
CLC                           ; F8                   [8086] 
CLD                           ; FC                   [8086] 
CLI                           ; FA                   [8086] 
CLTS                          ; 0F 06                [286,PRIV]
```
These instructions clear various flags. CLC clears the carry flag; CLD clears the direction flag;
CLI clears the interrupt flag (thus disabling interrupts); and CLTS clears the task-switched (TS) flag in CR0.

### STC, STD, STI: Set Flags

```
STC                           ; F9                   [8086] 
STD                           ; FD                   [8086] 
STI                           ; FB                   [8086]
```

These instructions set various flags. STC sets the carry flag; STD sets the direction flag; and STI sets the interrupt flag (thus enabling interrupts).

### ADC instruction in ASM 8086

Few things about the 8086 ADC instruction:
```
Syntax: adc dest, src
dest: memory or register
src:  memory, register, or immediate
Action: dest = dest + src + CF
```

### POP/PUSH

POP - Pop Word off Stack

Usage: 

	POP dest

Modifies Flags: None

Transfers word at the current stack top (SS:SP) to the destination then increments SP by two to point to the new stack top.
CS is not a valid destination.

---

POPA/POPAD - Pop All Registers onto Stack (80188+)

Usage: 

	POPA
	POPAD (386+)

Modifies Flags: None

Pops the top 8 words off the stack into the 8 general purpose 16/32 bit registers. Registers are popped in the following order:
(E)DI, (E)SI, (E)BP, (E)SP, (E)DX, (E)CX and (E)AX. The (E)SP value popped from the stack is actually discarded.

---

POPF/POPFD - Pop Flags off Stack

Usage: 	

	POPF
	POPFD (386+)

Modifies Flags: All

Pops word/doubleword from stack into the Flags Register and then increments SP by 2 (for POPF) or 4 (for POPFD).

---

PUSH - Push Word onto Stack

Usage: 

	PUSH src	
	PUSH immed (80188+ only)

Modifies Flags: None

Decrements SP by the size of the operand (two or four, byte values are sign extended) and transfers one word from source to the stack top (SS:SP).

---

PUSHA/PUSHAD - Push All Registers onto Stack (80188+)

Usage: 

	PUSHA
	PUSHAD (386+)

Modifies Flags: None

Pushes all general purpose registers onto the stack in the following order: (E)AX, (E)CX, (E)DX, (E)BX, (E)SP, (E)BP, (E)SI, (E)DI.
The value of SP is the value before the actual push of SP.

---

PUSHF/PUSHFD - Push Flags onto Stack

Usage:
 
	PUSHF
	PUSHFD (386+)

Modifies Flags: None

Transfers the Flags Register onto the stack. PUSHF saves a 16 bit value while PUSHFD saves a 32 bit value.

### Assembly Numbers

#### ASCII Representation

In ASCII representation, decimal numbers are stored as string of ASCII characters. For example, the decimal
value 1234 is stored as:
```
31 32 33 34H
```
Where, 31H is ASCII value for 1, 32H is ASCII value for 2, and so on. There are the following four instructions for
processing numbers in ASCII representation:
```
 AAA - ASCII Adjust After Addition
 AAS - ASCII Adjust After Subtraction
 AAM - ASCII Adjust After Multiplication
 AAD - ASCII Adjust Before Division
```

#### BCD Representation

There are two types of BCD representation:

* Unpacked BCD representation
* Packed BCD representation

In unpacked BCD representation, each byte stores the binary equivalent of a decimal digit. For example, the
number 1234 is stored as:
```
01 02 03 04H
```
There are two instructions for processing these numbers:
```
AAM - ASCII Adjust After Multiplication
AAD - ASCII Adjust Before Division
```
The four ASCII adjust instructions, AAA, AAS, AAM and AAD can also be used with unpacked BCD
representation. In packed BCD representation, each digit is stored using four bits. Two decimal digits are packed
into a byte. For example, the number 1234 is stored as:
```
12 34H
```
There are two instructions for processing these numbers:
```
DAA - Decimal Adjust After Addition
DAS - decimal Adjust After Subtraction
```
There is no support for multiplication and division in packed BCD representation.

### SECTION or SEGMENT: Changing and Defining Sections

The SECTION directive (SEGMENT is an exactly equivalent synonym) changes which section of the output file the code
you write will be assembled into. In some object file formats, the number and names of sections are fixed; in others,
the user may make up as many as they wish. Hence SECTION may sometimes give an error message, or may define a new
section, if you try to switch to a section that does not (yet) exist.

The Unix object formats, and the bin object format, all support the standardized section
names .text, .data and .bss for the code, data and uninitialized-data sections. The obj format, by contrast,
does not recognize these section names as being special, and indeed will strip off the leading period of any
section name that has one.
