# The Par ts of a Program


* The data section
* The bss section
* The text section

The text section is required in all assembly language programs. It is where the instruction codes
are declared within the executable program. 

The data and bss sections are optional, but often usedwithin a program. The data section declares
data elements that are declared with an initial value.These data elements are used as variables
within the assembly language program. 

The bss sectiondeclares data elements that are instantiated with a zero (or null) value. These data elements are most
often used as buffer areas within the assembly language program.
